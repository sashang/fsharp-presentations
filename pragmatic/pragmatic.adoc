== Goal

* How to make your life 10% better

== Async

* Back in the day I was writing code like this:

[.notes]
--
In the mid 2000s I was writing code like this.
Inversion of control
Shared state
--

[source, c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the callback function type
typedef void (*CallbackFunction)(Downloads result);

void perform_download(char*[] urls, CallbackFunction callback) {
    // Perform blocking IO operation
    Downloads result = download(urls)

    // Call the callback function with the result
    callback(result);
}

void process_download_results(Downloads result) {
    // do something with the results
}

int main() {
    perform_download(urls, process_download_results);

    return 0;
}
----

== Async

* The question we want to answer is this

[source, c]
----
int main() {
    perform_download(urls, process_download_results);
    // how to handle the result here? <<1>>
    .
    .
    .
    .

}
----

1. How do we process the result of the download in the main function?

== Async When?

[%steps]
* Go coroutines - 2012
* JavaScript Promises - 2015
* C# async/await - 2012
* Python async/await - 2015
* Java CompletableFuture - 2015
* F# async/await - 2007
* Erlang was released in 1986

== Async

[source, fs]
----
let downloadAsync (url: string) =
    async {
        let! response = httpClient.GetAsync(url) |> Async.AwaitTask
        let! content = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync() |> Async.AwaitTask
        return content
    }
----

== Async

* Closures
* Immutability

== Async caveats

[source, fsharp, linenums, highlight=3..5]
----
let downloadAll =
    let results = [
        for url in urls do
            let! result = donwloadAsync url <1>
            result
    ]
    results
----

<1> The use of let col in sequence expression is not permitted.

Sequence expressions are also computation expressions

== Async

[source,fsharp,linenums, highlight=4]
----
let downloadAll =
    let results = [
        for url in urls do
            let result = downloadAsync url
            result
    ]
    results |> Async.Parallel
----

== Async

* Use asyncSeq

[source,fsharp,linenums]
----
let downloadAll2 =
    asyncSeq {
        for url in urls do
            let! result = downloadAsync url
            result
    }
downloadAll2 |> AsyncSeq.toArrayAsync |> Async.RunSynchronously
----

== Domain Driven Design

* Model the business domain with the type system

== REST

* No nulls

== Hurdles

* Immutability
* Strange looks
* Corporate culture

== How to use <your favourite language> in your organization

* Make a case for it.
* Don't do it as a playground project.
    - Research the problem you're trying to solve. What are the key aspects of the domain?
    - List how the language addresses common problems in other langauges
* Fundamentally businesses don't care how you get the result.

== How to use <your favourite language> in your organization

* A service that has to serve a high volume of requests. Response involves complex numerical calculations.
