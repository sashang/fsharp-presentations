== Async

* Back in the day I was writing code like this:

[.notes]

In the mid 2000s I was writing code like this.
Inversion of control
Shared state
--

[source, c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the callback function type
typedef void (*CallbackFunction)(Downloads result);

void perform_download(char*[] urls, CallbackFunction callback) {
    // Perform blocking IO operation
    Downloads result = download(urls)

    // Call the callback function with the result
    callback(result);
}

void process_download_results(Downloads result) {
    // do something with the results
}

int main() {
    perform_download(urls, process_download_results);

    return 0;
}
----

== Async

* The question we want to answer is this

[source, c]
----
int main() {
    perform_download(urls, process_download_results);
    // how to handle the result here? <<1>>
    .
    .
    .
    .

}
----

1. How do we process the result of the download in the main function?

== Async

* When?

[%step]
* Go coroutines version 1.0 was released in 2012
* JavaScript Promises were introduced in 2015
* C# async/await was introduced in 2012
* Python async/await was introduced in 2015
* Java CompletableFuture was introduced in 2015
* F# async/await was introduced in 2007
* Erlang was released in 1986


== Async

[source, fsharp]
----
let donwloadAsync (url: string) =
    async {
        let! response = httpClient.GetAsync(url) |> Async.AwaitTask
        let! content = response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync() |> Async.AwaitTask
        return content
    }

== Async

* Closures
* Immutability

* Use asyncSeq

let downloadAll2 =
    asyncSeq {

    }
downloadAll2 |> AsyncSeq.toArrayAsync |> Async.RunSynchronously
